## About This Project

This project was completed as part of the premium course at [profy.dev](https://profy.dev/employers). This course mimics a professional real world development environment.

Designs were provided via [Figma](https://www.figma.com/). The project was split into small tasks using [ClickUp](https://clickup.com/) as a project management tool. I created a pull request for every task.

Here's what I learned while working on this project:

* **Creating pixel-perfect designs**
* **Creating custom React hooks [[1]](https://github.com/profydev/reddit-timer-wjkmartin/blob/main/src/hooks/useInput.js)[[2]](https://github.com/profydev/reddit-timer-wjkmartin/blob/main/src/hooks/useFetchPosts.js)**
* **[Implement data fetching with error handling](https://github.com/profydev/reddit-timer-wjkmartin/blob/main/src/hooks/useFetchPosts.js)**
* **Writing integration tests**
* **Professional Git workflow with pull requests**
* **Code reviews**
* **Continuous integration**

I was given designs, user stories, and acceptance criteria and was given full control over the implementation details as long as I used React. 

The code reviews gave me insights into best practices to follow (see [this example](https://github.com/profydev/reddit-timer-wjkmartin/pull/7#pullrequestreview-805303855)). I was able to learn a lot and evolve my front-end knowledge rapidly.
